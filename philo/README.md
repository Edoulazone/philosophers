# Philosophers

## The project

This project is about creating multiple threads at the same time and making them able to interact together (probably, I'm not sure I understand it all very well).

### Global rules

• Global variables are forbidden!

• Your(s) program(s) should take the following arguments: number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]

	◦ number_of_philosophers: The number of philosophers and also the number of forks.

	◦ time_to_die (in milliseconds): If a philosopher didn’t start eating time_to_die milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.

	◦ time_to_eat (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During that time, they will need to hold two forks.

	◦ time_to_sleep (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.

	◦ number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional argument): If all philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a philosopher dies.

• Each philosopher has a number ranging from 1 to number_of_philosophers.

• Philosopher number 1 sits next to philosopher number number_of_philosophers. Any other philosopher number N sits between philosopher number N - 1 and philosopher number N + 1.

About the logs of your program:

• Any state change of a philosopher must be formatted as follows:
	◦ timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork
	◦ timestamp_in_ms X is eating
	◦ timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping
	◦ timestamp_in_ms X is thinking
	◦ timestamp_in_ms X died
	Replace timestamp_in_ms with the current timestamp in milliseconds and X with the philosopher number.

• A displayed state message should not be mixed up with another message.

• A message announcing a philosopher died should be displayed no more than 10 ms
after the actual death of the philosopher.

• Again, philosophers should avoid dying!

## 1 Mandatory part

### 1.1 Rules:

• Each philosopher should be a thread.

• There is one fork between each pair of philosophers. Therefore, if there are several philosophers, each philosopher has a fork on their left side and a fork on their right side. If there is only one philosopher, there should be only one fork on the table.

• To prevent philosophers from duplicating forks, you should protect the forks state with a mutex for each of them

### 1.2 External functions

memset, printf, malloc, free, write, usleep, gettimeofday, pthread_create, pthread_detach, pthread_join, pthread_mutex_init, pthread_mutex_destroy, pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_mutex_unlock
